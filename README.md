# Windows Settings Extractor

## Description

This is a extraction script I have developed for extracting configurations from Windows for the purpose of performing security configuration review against the Center for Internet Security (CIS) baselines.

## Why was VBScript (.vbs) chosen?

VBScript was chosen as it is supported by all default installation of Windows. Thus, there is no need to install any other programming languages to run this script.
